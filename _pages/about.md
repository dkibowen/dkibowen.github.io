I am a Statistician, currently working as Analytics and Reporting Lead [Supply Chain Department](https://mabati.com/) at [Mabati Rolling Mills](https://mabati.com/) a member of the [Safal Group](https://www.safalgroup.com/).

I am interested in the teaching and learning of Statistics and Data Science at all levels, from primary through graduate school.  I am engaged in various projects related to data science in schools, online learning, inverted classrooms, statistics curriculum development, achieving adaptive expertise, and the development of professional identity.
